**WARNING: This repository is meant to get Cockpit Next deployed on a Dokku instance. It is meant for personal use, and while you are more than welcome to use it, do not expect support with it. For all information about Cockpit itself, please visit [Cockpit on Github](https://github.com/agentejo/cockpit).**

### Changes

Some modifications where made in order for the deployment to work as expected:

* Change to the Dockerfile to include the repository
* Change in the bootstrap script to use the default MONGO_URL instead of the COCKPIT_DATABASE_SERVER and COCKPIT_DATABASE_NAME

### Requirements

* Docker
* Dokku
* Dokku Mongo Addon
* Dokku Letsencrypt Addon


### Installation

1. Download the Cockpit Dokku repository (as a repo, not as git) to your development machine
2. Make sure your development machine has the rights to push to the Dokku instance
3. Add the Dokku remote address: `git remote add dokku dokku@your.dokku.url:APPNAME` where `your.dokku.url` points to your machine and `APPNAME` is the name of your Cockpit application
4. Push to your code to Dokku: either use `git push dokku master` or `git push dokku master:refs/heads/master` when the first one fails (sometimes this happens on first builds).
5. Login to your Dokku instance and create a new MongoDB: `dokku mongo:create APPNAMEDB` where `APPNAMEDB` is the name of your mongo database.
6. Link your Mongo Database to your application: `dokku mongo:link APPNAMEDB APPNAME` where `APPNAMEDB` is the name of your db in step 5 and `APPNAME` is the name of your app in step 3.
7.
